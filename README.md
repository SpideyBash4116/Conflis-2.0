# Conflis-2.0
Unfortunately, Conflis was supossedly made in Python. So, I decide to make an upgrade on C++. Luckily, I have an upgrade.
- New Setup Page
- Users
- Settings
- Assistant
- Wallpapers

That's all the features today. Have a good day. Dont forget about the search feature coming tomorrow.


Sincerely Yours,
(c) Conflis Team
Note:
This update took half an hour of hard work. We had to work with C++, we used advanced learning, install and more. Please comment us here and the Conflis Team will get back to you.
